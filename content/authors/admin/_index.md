I move between phonetics and phonology while I investigate sounds and melodies of human languages. The focus of my research is prosody, and I use experimental techniques to disclose form-function mappings in tonal and intonational contours. I do fieldwork in San Basilio de Palenque, Colombia ever since I began to explore intonational variation of bilingual creole speakers. I have taught Spanish at all levels, advanced Spanish grammar and Spanish phonetics at the Univerisity of Massachusetts Amherst and other universities.

A second area of specialization is dialectology which I combine with functional principal component analyses of intonation.
